⭐Registration Form Web Application

A client-side Registration Form Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application focuses on input validation, user data handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation to demonstrate fundamental front-end development skills.

Overview

This project implements a structured registration workflow where users can enter personal details and submit them through a validated form. Upon successful validation, the submitted data is displayed dynamically in a tabular format without refreshing the page.

The application follows best practices in form handling, user input validation, and clean UI presentation.
